# phaser-project
This project is a **Phaser 3 game** written in vanilla **JavaScript**.

It was made as part of my contribution to a website for children with **dysgraphia** (children that have difficulties spelling correctly due to a neurological disorder).

The game has the following features:
- audio tasks and cues;
- pacman-like animated character that can move across the grid via mouse clicks;
- landing on the right cell results in awarded points/stars;
- landing on the wrong cells results in decreased attempts;
